# rust-game

This is an early developmental / experimental game being built in the Bevy language.

I'm using this project to learn Bevy and Rust as I begin to experiment outside of my comfort zone of managed languages (C#/JS/PHP, etc) to system style languages (Go/Rust/Zig). As such if your hear looking for "good clean idiomatic rust" you might need to look elsewhere as it's likely to be a bit of a mess as I discover and learn the ins and outs of Bevy. Rust I've used in some private projects but nothing as big as a game before, so excitement will ensue, and maybe even some WGSL.

## Possible MODs for speeding up development. 

- bevy_hanabi - particles
- kayak-ui - ui
- bevy_asset_loader - extended asset loading
- oxidized_navigation - path finding
- bevy_kira_audio - audio 
- Kurinji - input mapping
- bevy_tweening (bevy_easings) - easing between things, pulsing etc
- seldom_State state management 
- bevy_wave_collapse wave collapse meshes
- naga shader translator
- naia networking
- bevy_app_compute compute shaders

## Concepts for learning/implementing possibly
- spatial hash grid vs aabb
- Implementing LOD 
- Tilescaper
- Spiderman windows with internals
- distance fields vs raycast
- raymarching
